# Timekeeper

A Discord bot for keeping timezones straight!  Once a user sets themselves up, the bot will reply to any of their posts that contain times (which can be formatted like 8pm, 8:30 PM, or 9:00) with those times as timestamps that will show the converted time for anyone!

Only one command is needed to use the bot:  
`/timekeeper` - The bot will provide dropdowns where you can select your time zone and daylight savings time settings.  Once you have selected a time zone, the bot will start monitoring your messages in any server it has joined!
