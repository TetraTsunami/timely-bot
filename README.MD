# Timekeeper

A Discord bot for keeping timezones straight!  Once a user sets themselves up, the bot will reply to any of their posts that contain times (which can be formatted like 8pm, 8:30 PM, 9:00) with those times converted into timestamps!

There are two commands needed to get started:  
`/timekeeper` - This command is how you select your time zone.  
`/timekeeper_dst` - This command is how you select your daylight savings time setting.
