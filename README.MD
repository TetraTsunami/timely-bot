# Timekeeper

A Discord bot for keeping timezones straight!  Once a user sets themselves up, the bot will reply to any of their posts that contain times (which can be formatted like 8pm, 8:30 PM, or 9:00) with those times as timestamps that will show the converted time for anyone!

There are two commands used to interact with the bot:  
`/timekeeper` - This command is how you select your time zone.  Once this is set up, the bot will begin replying to your posts with converted times.  
`/timekeeper_dst` *(optional)* - This command is how you select your daylight savings time setting.
