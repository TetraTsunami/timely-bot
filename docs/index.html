			<h2>What is Timekeeper?</h2>
			<p>
				Timekeeper is a <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> bot for managing times for users across the world using Discord's <a href="https://hammertime.djdavid98.art/" target="_blank">timestamp</a> feature.  Once a user has set up their time zone with the bot, it will monitor their posts.  If the user posts anything with a time in it, the bot will reply with that time converted to a timestamp, which will display as the correct local time for whoever views it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Times will be recognized if they are formatted like <span class="command">8:30 PM</span>, <span class="command">8pm</span>, or <span class="command">8:30</span>.  The bot can convert more than one time in a post, but it will ignore posts with more than 4 time entries to avoid spamminess.

			<h2>Using Timekeeper</h2>
			<p>
				The first thing you need to get started is to invite the bot to your server, of course!
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=940552993609240616&permissions=2048&scope=bot%20applications.commands" target="_blank">https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=940552993609240616&permissions=2048&scope=bot%20applications.commands</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the bot is in your server, any user can set up their time zone and daylight savings info by using the <span class="command">/timekeeper</span> command.  This will show the user a pair of dropdowns for selecting their settings.
			</p>
			<aside>
				<div id="config-blank"></div>
			</aside>
			<p>
				After a user has entered their settings, then the bot will start working!  Whenever that user makes a post, the bot will check it to see if it includes times.  If any times are found, it will reply to the post with those times as a timestamp!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Important:</strong> Timekeeper can only convert times from the user's local time zone to timestamps.  Any times you post <em>must</em> be in your local time zone to be converted correctly.  If you were to try to write a time as <span class="command">2 PM UTC</span>, Timekeeper would convert it as if it were 2 PM in your own time zone!
