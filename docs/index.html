			<h2>What is Timekeeper?</h2>
			<p>
				Timekeeper is a <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> bot for managing times for users across the world using Discord's <a href="https://hammertime.djdavid98.art/" target="_blank">timestamp</a> feature.  Once a user has set up their time zone with the bot, it will monitor their posts.  If the user posts anything with a time in it, the bot will reply with that time converted to a timestamp, which will display as the correct local time for whoever views it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Times will be recognized if they are formatted like <span class="command">8:30 PM</span>, <span class="command">8pm</span>, or <span class="command">8:30</span>.  The bot can convert more than one time in a post, but it will ignore posts with more than 4 time entries to avoid spamminess.
			</p>
			<p>
				A time zone may also be specified (<i>e.g.</i> <span class="command">6:00 PM EST</span>).  Timekeeper currently recognizes the following time zones: <span class="command">EST</span>/<span class="command">EDT</span>, <span class="command">CST</span>/<span class="command">CDT</span>, <span class="command">MST</span>/<span class="command">MDT</span>, <span class="command">PST</span>/<span class="command">PDT</span>, and <span class="command">UTC</span>.

			<h2>Using Timekeeper</h2>
			<p>
				In a server that has the bot, any user can set up their time zone and daylight savings info by using the <span class="command">/timekeeper</span> command.  This will show the user a pair of dropdowns for selecting their settings.
			</p>
			<aside>
				<div id="config-blank"></div>
			</aside>
			<p>
				After a user has entered their settings, then the bot will start working!  Whenever that user makes a post, the bot will check it to see if it includes times.  If any times are found, it will reply to the post with those times as a timestamp!
